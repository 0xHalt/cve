# cve

This repository contains a C program designed to demonstrate the crafting of a WebP image file, to rewrite and manipulate memory. The code serves as a proof-of-concept illustrating how these specific vulnerabilities can be targeted through crafted WebP images.  


This works in chromium's/electron's image handling libraries. This still currently affects a lot of software/programs, which is why I'm not giving instructions because I don't want retards to use it. It was recently patched in official publications of discord but potentially still works in lightcord, powercord, and betterdiscord versions.
